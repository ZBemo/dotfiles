WARNING: I haven't tested any of the scripts and dotfiles on a fresh manjaro install yet, so it might not work completely

Notices:
 - In /home/user/deluge/ there are multiple references to /home/zbemo which would not be the correct location for anyone who isn't me. You can either change that yourself, or just not use the deluge config files, as they're barely changed from fresh-install settings
